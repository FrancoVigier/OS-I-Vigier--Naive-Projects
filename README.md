Naives Implementations to learn concurrent programming concepts
Naive implementations of exercises to learn the POSIX PTHREAD library and concepts such as
parent-child processes, mutex, deadlock, etc. We have:
- Monte Carlo PTHREAD
- Simulation of a shell (with possibility to run command in the background)
- Philosophers dinner
- Try of concurrent stack
